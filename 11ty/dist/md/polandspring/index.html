        <p>Poland Spring water is indefinitely the best water brand. It is the most popular water brand and most well rounded in my opinion. People that buy Fiji water want you to know that they have money. Dasani is just straight trash, it's legitimate tap water. Voss is also some boujee brand that's only in like hotel rooms. But Poland Spring is just the best bang for your buck and it tastes good.</p>
