Häagen-Dazs is the best ice cream. It is very high quality and other brands can not compare. However, it is the most expensive ice cream known to the human race. I would love to consume Häagen-Dazs ice cream every day, however the pockets would hurt. Carvel and Cold Stone the more afforable option, sike I lied maybe not Cold Stone. But Carvel is. However, the taste simply does not compare.
