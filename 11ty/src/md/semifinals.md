May 24, 2022, was most definitely one of the hardest days of this year for me. I came into Staten Island Tech knowing absolutely nothing about volleyball, and I was lucky enough to make the team. However, that was the last year that we won. I never would've thought that I would one day be standing as a starter and making it as far as we did this to the semi-finals and losing each set by about only 2 points each. Now that I'm graduating, the effects of this loss have multiplied tenfold for me, knowing that I couldn't continue our spree of winning. I am glad to call this team my second family, and I am forever grateful for everything Mr. Rerick and my team has done for me. Also SILIVE made a story about us losing but it's subscribers only, they're milking money out of our loss.
